A smart bicycle system that can detect oncoming cars using machine learning. The system uses a camera mounted on the bicycle to capture images of the road. These images are then processed using a machine learning model to detect the presence of cars. If a car is detected, the system sends an alert to the cyclist, allowing them to take appropriate action to avoid a potential collision.

The project was developed as part of HackDavis 2022, where it won the following award:

- Most Technically Challenging Hack
