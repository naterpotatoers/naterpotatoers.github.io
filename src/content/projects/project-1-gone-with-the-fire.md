Gone with the Fire is a wildfire monitoring system built using a distributed LoRaWAN network. The system collects data from various sensors deployed in the field and sends it to an Azure webserver for processing and analysis. The data is then visualized on a web application, allowing users to monitor the status of the sensors in real-time.

The project was developed as part of SCEHacks 2021, where it won several awards, including:

- 1st Place Overall ($500)
- Best Use of Azure
