Smart Flask is an IoT water bottle that tracks water consumption via an ESP32, ultrasonic sensors, and an IMU. It sends that data to our deployed React/Node/MySQL services hosted on GCP via CICD pipelines. We have a UI that allows users to set goals and track their water consumption.

The project was developed as part of CruzHacks 2022, where it won several awards, including:

- Best Health Hack
- MLH's Best Hardware Hack
- QB3's Best Big Data for the Improvement of Health Care ($1000)
