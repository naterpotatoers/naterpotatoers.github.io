An IoT barbell collar that automatically records number of reps and time under tension. The device utilizes a Raspberry Pi Pico W, an IMU, and a custom 3-button OLED interface that allows users to select exercises and weight. It automatically tracks workout metrics and integrates with a full-stack TypeScript/React/Node/MySQL application deployed on AWS infrastructure via CICD pipeline. The web application provides a user-friendly interface for users to view their workout data, track progress, and set fitness goals. The system is designed to help users optimize their workouts and improve their overall fitness.

The project was developed as part of CruzHacks 2023, where it won the following award:
